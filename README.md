# low-power-ereader

## Idea

I've been thinking about a project which combines many of my greatest interests:

- Bible
- Programming
- Computers (especially low power computers)
- Electronics
- Languages (both programming l. and natural l.)

I'd like to have a small device which

- can store & display ebooks (e.g. Bible)
- uses extremely little power (1~10 mW would be nice)
- supports ebooks in many languages
- supports copying ebooks between devices
- supports ebook-creation on low-power computers (e.g. RPi)
- is debuggable/reprogrammable with low-power computers
- is repairable, as easily as possible
- is completely open (hardware, software, formats)
- is as simple as possible (hardware, software, formats)

Let's see if I can make this reality during 2017 ... or ever ... :)
